## Implementing Snark.js and Using It to Manage Contract Data with zk-SNARKs

To implement **Snark.js** and use it for managing contract data using zk-SNARKs, it is essential to follow a structured approach. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it.

## **1. Installing Snark.js and Circom**

```bash
npm install -g snarkj
```

You will also need **Circom**, which is the circuit compiler. Follow the instructions in its official repository to install it. [How to install Circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-dependencies)

## **2. Powers of Tau Ceremony Configuration**

### **Initialize Project**

Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir snarkjs_project
cd snarkjs_project
```

### **Start the Powers of Tau Ceremony**

Run the following command to begin the ceremony:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 14 pot14_0000.ptau -v
```

This command establishes a ceremony using the bn128 curve and allows a maximum of 16,384 constraints.
-   **`powersoftau`**: This is the first setup phase to generate a `.ptau` (Powers of Tau) file, which contains the necessary bases for building zk-SNARK circuits.
    
-   **`bn128`**: Specifies the BN128 curve (equivalent to BN254), which is the pairable curve used by Semaphore and zk-SNARK. 
    
-   **`14`**: This is the number of powers (Power of Tau) that defines the maximum circuit size in terms of constraints. The value `14` corresponds to circuits with up to 2^{14} = (16,384) constraints, which is more than sufficient for a Semaphore circuit.
    
-   **`pot14_0000.ptau`**: This is the output file generated in this initial phase. It will be used as a starting point for trust setup in proof generation.
    
-   **`-v`**: Verbose mode, provides additional details during execution.

### **Contribute to the Ceremony**

You can contribute to the ceremony as follows:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot14_0000.ptau pot14_0001.ptau --name="First contribution" -v
```

This will generate a new `ptau` file that includes your contribution.

### **Verify the Ceremony**

After making contributions, verify the current state of the ceremony with:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau verify pot14_0001.ptau
```

## **3. Prepare and Generate Proof Keys**

### **Prepare Phase 2**

Once you have completed the contributions, prepare phase 2 with the following command:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot14_beacon.ptau pot14_final.ptau -v
```

This command will generate a final `ptau` file that will be used to generate the circuit's proof and verification keys.

### **Generate Proof and Verification Keys**

Use the following command to generate the keys:

```bash
snarkjs groth16 setup circuit.json pot14_final.ptau circuit_0000.zkey
```

This creates a `zkey` file containing the keys necessary to prove the circuit.

## **4. Test and Verify the Circuit**

Once you have your keys, you can test your circuit with specific data. To do this, first generate a proof:

```bash
snarkjs groth16 prove circuit_0000.zkey input.json proof.json public.json
```

Finally, verify the generated proof:

```bash
snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
```

## **5. Integration with Smart Contracts**

To use the data generated by Snark.js in smart contracts:

- Export the verification keys to a compatible format.
- Implement the smart contract that uses these keys to verify zk-SNARK proofs.

1. Generate proof using JavaScript

```bash
async function generateProof() {
  try {
    const { proof, publicSignals } = await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve(
      { secret: 12345 },
      "circuit_js/circuit.wasm",
      "circuit_0000.zkey"
    );
    console.log("Public Signals:", publicSignals);
    console.log("Proof:", proof);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating proof:", error);
  }
}
generateProof().then(() => process.exit(0));

```

This generates the publicSignals and proof, which can be passed to the SmartContract.

You can extract this as a JSON file using:

```bash
npx snarkjs zkey export verificationkey circuit_0000.zkey verification_key.json
```

Before using the above, it's important to have the smart contract deployed to receive the following inputs:

`a, b, c:` are internal components of the generated zk-SNARK proof, representing the mathematical calculations necessary to prove that the circuit conditions are met.

`pubSignals:` are the public data that the verifier uses to validate the proof, without compromising the privacy of private inputs.

```
const { Client } = require('soroban-sdk');

async function callVerifyProof(proof, publicSignals) {
  const client = new Client({ server: 'https://testnet.soroban.network' }); 
  
  // Format data
  const formattedProof = {
    a: [proof.pi_a[0], proof.pi_a[1]],
    b: [
      [proof.pi_b[0][0], proof.pi_b[0][1]],
      [proof.pi_b[1][0], proof.pi_b[1][1]]
    ],
    c: [proof.pi_c[0], proof.pi_c[1]]    
  };

  // Contract call
  const result = await client.call({
    contractId: 'ContractID', // Replace with your actual ContractID
    method: 'verify_proof',
    args: [
      formattedProof.a,
      formattedProof.b,
      formattedProof.c,
      publicSignals 
    ]
  });

  console.log('Verification Result:', result);
}

callVerifyProof(proof, publicSignals);

```

For testing, you can also directly use the generated `proof.json` and `public.json` files by importing them accordingly.
